# Licenses

### Commercial/Proprietary
	The Service is commercially available, the source code is not released, and has rules for what can be done with it, depending on the software

	ex:
		- "SaaS"/Subscription (ex: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Game Pass, Adobe Software, World Of Warcraft)
		- Lifetime License/upfront cost - (ex: Most Video Games, Windows)
		- "Free" - but not OSS or free as according to GNU (ex: Adobe Acrobat, Google Chrome, Youtube)
		- "Token Based" - Pay for a set amount of Tokens/Credits to use the service (ex: AI APIs)

### Copyleft
	Free as in Freedom!🦅
	Any version of the software that is released must be released under the same, upgraded, or compatible license.
	ex:
		- MPL  (Mozilla Public License)
		- GPL  (GNU General Public License)
		- AGPL (GNU Affero General Public License)
		- LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License) - Can be used in commercial offerings, but the library must be able to be taken out and replaced,

### Permissive
	It can be used, modified, and shared freely with few restrictions, such as providing credit. They also commonly state no Warrenty is provided, and the creator is not liable if the software is used in illegal ways.

	ex:
		- MIT License(yes, like the university)
		- BSD License (Yes, as in the University and the OS)
		- Apache License (Not as in the Helicopters)


### Public
	Creator is giving up all rights to it, people can do whatever they want, Creator is under no obligation to provide support of any kind
	ex:
		- Unlicense
		- WTFPL (What the F*ck you want to license) - only say the acronym, not accepted by the Open Source Initiative
		- ICCLEIYSIUYA ("I Couldn't Care Less Even If You Stuff It Up Your Ass") - Only Say the Acronym - Not Accepted by the Open Source Initiative

## OSI( Open Source Initiative)

	The Open source initiative defines open source as:
    - No restrictions on selling or distributing the software as part of a distribution with software from other sources, and cannot require a royalty
    - Must include Source code, and allow distributing through source code, or if not through source code, it must be easy to find the source code, and it must be the original source code, not an obfuscated form.
    - Must allow public modifications that are released under the same license.
    - The license may only restrict source code from being distributed modified if it allows "patch files" that modify the program at build time, the license must allow distribution using a modification of the source, but it can force it to be under a different name
    - It cannot discriminate against any person or group
    - It can't block what fields can use it
    - The program's rules cannot require accepting another license, such as signing an NDA to use it
    - The license cannot depend on the program being in a specific software distribution 
    - The license cannot restrict other software that it's distributed with.
    - it cannot require other technologies in order to distribute as according to the license, such as clicking a box during distribution
