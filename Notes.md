# Licenses

### Commercial/Proprietary
The Service is commercially available, the source code is not released, and has rules for what can be done with it, depending on the software

ex:
- "SaaS"/Subscription (ex: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Game Pass, Adobe Software, World Of Warcraft)
- Lifetime License/upfront cost - (ex: Most Video Games, Windows)
- "Free" - but not OSS or free as according to GNU (ex: Adobe Acrobat, Google Chrome, Youtube)
- "Token Based" - Pay for a set amount of Tokens/Credits to use the service (ex: AI APIs)

### Copyleft
Free as in Freedom!🦅
Any version of the software that is released must be released under the same, upgraded, or compatible license.
ex:
- MPL  (Mozilla Public License) - Created by Mozilla, used by Firefox, thunderbird, and plenty of other projects, weaker than the GPL in copyleft
- GPL  (GNU General Public License)
- AGPL (GNU Affero General Public License) - Strongest copyleft
- LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License) - Usually for libraries, in which case it can be used in commercial offerings, but the library must be able to be taken out and replaced, but is generally a weaker copyleft

### Permissive
It can be used, modified, and shared freely with few restrictions, such as providing credit. They also commonly state no Warrenty is provided, and the creator is not liable if the software is used in illegal ways.

ex:
- MIT License(yes, like the university)
- BSD License (Yes, as in the University and the OS)
- Apache License (Not as in the Helicopters)


### Public
Creator is giving up all rights to it, people can do whatever they want, Creator is under no obligation to provide support of any kind
ex:
- Unlicense
- WTFPL (What the F*ck you want to license) - only say the acronym, not accepted by the Open Source Initiative




# Important Organizations/Corporations/Individuals

## GNU(GNU's Not UNIX) and the FSF(Free Software Foundation), along with Stallman
Richard stallman is also a very controversial figure, to say the least, but he's also the founder of the GNU Project and Free Software Foundation. Gnu is a Free and Open Source alternative to the UNIX Operating System, which includes popular software such as:
- gcc
- gpg(GNU Privacy Guard)
- GRUB (GNU GRand Unified Bootloader)
- GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
- Emacs (Editor Macros)
- Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)
- nano (the simple text editor)
- And a lot more
And there's the FSF, or Free Software Foundation.
They hold copyright for, and sponsor GNU, along with many other projects that create free(as in freedom) software

all of their work is exclusively using free software, and usually under the GPL(or LGPL/AGPL), which they also enforce

they run many campaigns for Free(as in freedom), and privacy respecting firmware/software such as:
- GNU
- Defective By Design (which is about DRM being bad)
- PlayOgg (about using free audio/video formats that aren't patented)
- End Software Patents (self explanatory)
- Campaign for OpenDocument (about using free document formats in governments)
- Campaign for Hardware that Supports Free Software( about making free firmware)
- FreeBIOS (making Free BIOS)
- Librephone (about making a completely free software phone)
- Along with many others 

Their form of Open Source, they call Free Software, which they define as:

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


## OSI( Open Source Initiative)

The Open source initiative defines open source as:

- No restrictions on selling or distributing the software as part of a distribution with software from other sources, and cannot require a royalty

- Must include Source code, and allow distributing through source code, or if not through source code, it must be easy to find the source code, and it must be the original source code, not an obfuscated form.

- Must allow public modifications that are released under the same license.

- The license may only restrict source code from being distributed modified if it allows "patch files" that modify the program at build time, the license must allow distribution using a modification of the source, but it can force it to be under a different name

- It cannot discriminate against any person or group

- It can't block what fields can use it

- The program's rules cannot require accepting another license, such as signing an NDA to use it

- The license cannot depend on the program being in a specific software distribution 

- The license cannot restrict other software that it's distributed with.

- it cannot require other technologies in order to distribute as according to the license, such as clicking a box during distribution

The Open source Initiative is a group that tries to bring open source to the mainstream, and continue to build the community bigger and stronger
